<b>Instructions:</b>

Download the zip file which contains a folder containing the R code and all files for analysis. When running the R code, users will be prompted to located this folder ('Achilles Tendon'), which will then follow a hierarchy of folder locations to locate data files and create subfolders relative to this master folder location.

<b>Note:</b>

I am not a software engineer. If you have questions, I can attempt to help you. I cannot promise that this code will work on Mac or Unix systems. I have only tested this on a Windows machine.
